          <p>This is the surprisingly polarizing background music I use in my tutorial videos. I wrote this about five years ago and could never come up with a fitting melody, but I liked the mellow vibe, so I decided to use it in the background of my videos when I started the channel. I get quite a few comments from viewers liking the tune and many more of them hating it. The truth of it is, I live near an airport and without some kind of background music you&#39;d be able to hear airplanes flying over during my voiceovers. Or I&#39;d have to stop and start recording frequently to wait for the air traffic to clear. Making the voiceovers is already my least favorite part of the video creation process, so I don&#39;t want it to take any longer than it already does, so the background music is here to stay. Enjoy!</p>          </div>
